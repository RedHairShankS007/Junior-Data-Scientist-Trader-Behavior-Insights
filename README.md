## 📂 Datasets
1. **historical_data.csv**  
   - Includes account, coin, execution price, side, size, closed PnL, etc.  

2. **fear_greed_index.csv**

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Data loading & cleaning  
2. Date parsing & dataset merging
3. Data preprocessing and feature scaling for future predicition and data modelling
   - data normalization 
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - PnL distribution  
   - Number of trades  
   - Average PnL by sentiment  
6. Performance metrics  
   - Win rate by sentiment  
   - Daily PnL trends  
   - Account-level performance  
   - Coin-level performance  
7. Insights & conclusions
